# DLreproduction

This repo contains an attempt to reproduce the results from this repository: https://jiangzhengkai.github.io/LSTS/

We tried to rewrite the code to Python 3 and make it compilable on windows, but abandoned this attempt due to time contraints. Instead we tried to use the virtual environment Google Colab.

The link to the Google Colab can be found here: https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1Q3L6JcIbh7HnBFz_9jniFS2r5-6J-Xv-?usp=sharing

Because Google Cloud uses a terminal rather than a notebook like Colab it is not really possible to link to what we did. For the whole process we refer to our blog:
